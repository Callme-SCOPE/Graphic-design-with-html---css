                            A statement by the National Storytelling Network defines 
                            Storytelling as an ancient art form and a valuable form of human expression. 
                            Because story is essential to so many art forms, however, the word “storytelling” 
                            is often used in many ways

                            an art worth promoting, and to help those outside the storytelling community to 
                            distinguish storytelling from other, related forms of human expression.
